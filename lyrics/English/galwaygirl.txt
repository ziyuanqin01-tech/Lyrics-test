She played the fiddle in an Irish band
[00:02.60]But she fell in love with an English man
[00:05.10]Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
[00:07.30]Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
[00:09.40]I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
[00:12.00]She shared a *****ette with me while her brother played the guitar
[00:14.50]She asked me what does it mean the Gaelic ink on your arm?
[00:16.80]Said it was one of my friend's songs do you want to drink on?
[00:19.10]She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
[00:21.60]She got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding as shot gun
[00:24.50]Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
[00:26.40]Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know
[00:29.20]She played the fiddle in an Irish band
[00:31.50]But she fell in love with an English man
[00:33.90]Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
[00:36.10]Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
[00:38.10]With my pretty little Galway Girl
[00:42.80]You're my pretty little Galway Girl
[00:48.10]You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
[00:50.50]And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
[00:52.90]As last orders were called, was when she stood on the *****
[00:55.30]After dancing to Kaleigh, singing to trad tunes
[00:57.70]I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
[01:00.10]Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
[01:02.40]Oh I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
[01:04.80]And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me, you know
[01:07.60]She played the fiddle in an Irish band
[01:09.80]But she fell in love with an English man
[01:12.30]Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
[01:14.60]Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
[01:16.50]My pretty little Galway girl
[01:20.00]My my my my my my my Galway girl
[01:24.70]My my my my my my my Galway girl
[01:29.50]My my my my my my my Galway girl
[01:36.30]Now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
[01:38.50]I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
[01:41.20]Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
[01:43.40]As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
[01:45.80]I walked her home then she took me inside
[01:48.00]Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
[01:50.70]I swear I'm going to put you in a song that I write
[01:52.90]About a Galway girl and a perfect night
[01:55.60]She played the fiddle in an Irish band
[01:57.80]But she fell in love with an English man
[02:00.30]Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
[02:02.50]Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
[02:04.40]My pretty little Galway girl
[02:08.00]My my my my my my my Galway girl
[02:12.60]My my my my my my my Galway girl
[02:17.40]My my my my my my my Galway girl
