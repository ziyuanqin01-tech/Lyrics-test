It's not simple to say

Most days I don't recognize me

That these shoes and this apron

That place and its patrons

Have taken more than I gave them

It's not easy to know

I'm not anything like I used to be

Although it's true

I was never attention's sweet center

I still remember that girl

She's imperfect but she tries

She is good but she lies

She is hard on herself

She is broken and won't ask for help

She is messy but she's kind

She is lonely most of the time

She is all of this mixed up

And baked in a beautiful pie

She is gone but she used to be mine

It's not what I asked for

Sometimes life just slips in through the back door

And carves out a person

And makes you believe it's all true

Oh now I got you

And you're not what I asked for

If I'm honest I know

I would give it all back for a chance to start over

And rewrite the ending or two

For the girl that I knew

Who was reckless just enough

Who gets her heart broken

And learns how to help herself

When she's bruised

And gets used by a man who can't love

And then you get stuck and be scared

Of the life that's inside her

Growing stronger every day

Till you finally remind her to fight

Just a little to bring back the fire in her eyes

That's been gone

But she used to be mine
