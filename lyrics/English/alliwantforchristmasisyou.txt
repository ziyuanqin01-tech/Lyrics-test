I don't want a lot for Christmas

There is just one thing I need

I don't care about the presents

Underneath the Christmas tree

I just want you for my own

More than you could ever know

Make my wish come true

All I want for Christmas is you, baby

You, baby

Oh, I just want you for my own

More than you could ever know

Make my wish come true

All I want for Christmas is you, baby

All the lights are shining so brightly, everywhere

And the sound of children's laughter like a choir

Everyone is singing "Oh, I love you"

I hear those sleigh bells ringing

Santa won't you bring me the one I really need

Won't you please bring my baby to me

Oh, I just want you for my own

More than you could ever know

Make my wish come true

All I want for Christmas is you, baby

Standing right outside my door

All I want for Christmas is you, baby

All I want for Christmas is you, baby

All I want for Christmas is you, baby
