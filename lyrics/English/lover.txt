We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January

This is our place, we make the rules

And there's a dazzling haze

A mysterious way about you, dear

Have I known you twenty seconds

Or twenty years?

Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close

Forever and ever?

And ah, take me out

And take me home

You're my, my, my, my

Lover

We can let our friends crash in the living room

This is our place, we make the call

And I'm highly suspicious

That everyone who sees you wants you

I've loved you three summers now, honey

But I want them all

Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close

Forever and ever?

And ah, take me out

And take me home

You're my, my, my, my

Lover

Ladies and gentlemen

Will you please stand

With every guitar string scar on my hand

I take this magnetic force of a man

To be my lover

My heart's been borrowed

And yours has been blue

All's well that ends well

To end up with you

Swear to be overdramatic and true

To my lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

And at every table

I'll save you a seat, lover

Can I go where you go?

And can we always be this close

Forever and ever?

And ah, take me out

And take me home

Your my, my, my, my

Oh, you're my, my, my, my

Darling, you're my, my, my, my

Lover
